  Tenant & Intune

  Microsoft Intune & Entra ID Lab

This project demonstrates end-to-end modern endpoint management and security using Microsoft Intune and Entra ID in a Windows 11 virtual lab. The goal was to simulate real enterprise scenarios: packaging and deploying apps, enforcing compliance, managing updates, and securing access with Conditional Access.

üîπ Lab Highlights

App Deployment ‚Üí Packaged VLC Media Player with the Win32 Content Prep Tool, deployed via Intune, and validated with detection rules.

Configuration Policies ‚Üí Enforced Windows Hello PIN requirements (length, complexity, history).

Update Management ‚Üí Created a Pilot Update Ring deferring feature updates by 7 days, quality updates by 2 days.

Endpoint Security ‚Üí Configured Microsoft Defender Antivirus (real-time + cloud protection, scheduled scans) and Defender Firewall (enabled for all profiles).

Conditional Access ‚Üí Built a policy requiring devices to be marked compliant before accessing Microsoft 365 apps.

Reporting & Monitoring ‚Üí Tracked compliance, app deployment status, and update ring assignments in the Intune Admin Center.

üîπ Challenges & Learning Process

VirtualBox limitations ‚Üí BitLocker was skipped since encryption can cause boot issues in VMs. Learned when to adapt lab design to the environment.

Policy conflicts ‚Üí Encountered PIN length conflicts between Endpoint Security and Configuration Profiles. Learned to consolidate settings and avoid overlap.

App packaging issues ‚Üí Needed to use .\IntuneWinAppUtil.exe correctly in Command Prompt, and confirm silent install commands for detection.

Conditional Access setup ‚Üí Had to disable Security Defaults in Entra to enable custom CA policies ‚Äî discovered how defaults vs. CA policies differ.

Sync delays ‚Üí Learned Intune reporting isn‚Äôt instant; forced device syncs and waited for compliance/app install state updates.

Each issue deepened understanding of how Intune and Entra ID behave in real-world environments.

Troubleshooting & Ticketing Approach (ServiceNow Mindset)

While working through this lab, I treated issues as if they were tickets coming from end users or system alerts. My approach:

Identify & categorize the issue ‚Üí e.g., ‚ÄúApp failed to install‚Äù ‚Üí categorize under Software Deployment.

Gather evidence ‚Üí Checked Intune logs, device sync status, and compliance reports before escalating.

Apply fixes ‚Üí Adjusted detection rules, corrected policy conflicts, retried syncs.

Document resolution ‚Üí Recorded root cause and fix steps (e.g., ‚ÄúConflicting PIN policies; resolved by consolidating settings in Endpoint Security‚Äù).

Close ticket with knowledge base update ‚Üí Treating each fix as something reusable for future incidents.

This reflects how I would approach real incidents in ServiceNow or another ITSM platform: structured, evidence-based, and documented.

üîπ Next Steps

Add BitLocker encryption testing outside VM environment.

Package additional Win32/MSI apps (7-Zip, Notepad++).

Expand Conditional Access with MFA and location-based rules.

Explore automation with PowerShell + Graph API for bulk deployments.

Created a brand-new Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) tenant.

Activated a Microsoft Intune Plan 1 Trial subscription (25 seats).

Verified the subscription in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (Billing ‚Üí Your products).

User Setup

Created / used a test Azure AD user.

Assigned an Intune license to that user in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (Licenses & apps).

MDM / Enrollment Configuration

In Intune admin center ‚Üí Devices ‚Üí Enrollment ‚Üí Windows enrollment ‚Üí Automatic Enrollment:

Set MDM user scope = All (so any licensed user‚Äôs device auto-enrolls).

In Entra admin center ‚Üí Devices ‚Üí Device settings:

Confirmed that users are allowed to join devices to Azure AD.

Reset Secure Boot keys to allow Win11 to pass requirements.

Windows 11 Virtual Machine

Installed VirtualBox 7.x.

Created a dedicated VM storage folder: D:\IT-Lab\VMs.

Downloaded official Windows 11 ISO (5.15 GB) via Microsoft‚Äôs MCT/download page.

Created new VM in VirtualBox with:

Windows 11 Pro (64-bit)

8 GB RAM (6144 MB)

2 CPUs (you can safely bump to 4 since you have 20 logical cores)

Chipset = ICH9

EFI + Secure Boot enabled

TPM 2.0 added

Video Memory = 128 MB

Graphics Controller = VBoxSVGA

SATA Controller (AHCI): Port 0 = Win11-Intune.vdi (64 GB), Port 1 = Optical Drive ‚Üí Windows11.iso

Use Host I/O Cache = On

Boot order: Optical ‚Üí Hard Disk

Windows 11 OOBE

Completed installer and OOBE screens step by step:

Set region, keyboard, skip second keyboard.

Chose Set up for work or school.

Signed in with Azure AD user (licensed).

Approved Microsoft Authenticator MFA.

Created a PIN that meets complexity requirements.

VM successfully booted to desktop as an Entra ID joined device.

# PXE booting Windows with WDS on Server 2022 (VirtualBox, UEFI)

## Goal

Stand up **Windows Deployment Services (WDS)** on Windows Server 2022 and UEFI-PXE boot a VirtualBox client on an **isolated lab network**.

---

## Lab Topology

* **Server**: Windows Server 2022
  Roles: AD DS, DNS, DHCP, WDS
  IP: `10.0.0.10/24` (Internal/isolated network)
* **DHCP Scope**: `10.0.0.100‚Äì10.0.0.200` (`255.255.255.0`)
* **VirtualBox network**: `Internal Network` (e.g., `LabNet`)
* **Client**: UEFI VM, NIC model **Intel PRO/1000** (E1000/E1000T)
  *Avoid paravirtualized/virtio ‚Äì PXE ROM isn‚Äôt there.*

> Tip: For UEFI console sizing I set:
> `VBoxManage setextradata "Test Client" "VBoxInternal2/EfiGraphicsResolution" "1024x768"`

---

## WDS & DHCP Configuration

* WDS **Properties ‚Üí DHCP**:

  * ‚úÖ *Do not listen on DHCP ports* (because DHCP is on same box)
  * ‚úÖ *Configure DHCP options to indicate this is also a PXE server*

* WDS **Properties ‚Üí Boot**:

  * PXE policy: *Always continue the PXE boot* (for known/unknown)
  * **x64 (UEFI) default boot image**: `Boot\x64\Images\boot.wim`

* Boot programs (verified/set via `wdsutil`):

  ```cmd
  wdsutil /set-server /bootprogram:boot\x64\wdsmgfw.efi /architecture:x64uefi
  wdsutil /set-server /n12bootprogram:boot\x64\wdsmgfw.efi /architecture:x64uefi
  ```

* **DHCP options 66/67**: **Not set** (UEFI uses DHCP options + PXE/WDS logic; hard-coding 67 often breaks UEFI).

* Firewall/TFTP/ProxyDHCP listening:

  ```cmd
  netstat -an | findstr ":69"    # TFTP
  netstat -an | findstr ":4011"  # ProxyDHCP (WDS)
  ```

---

## Initial Symptoms

* Client reached **WDS Boot Manager** but looped at **‚ÄúContacting Server (10.0.0.10)‚Äù**.
* Later: **0xc0000001** immediately after contacting the server.

**Root cause**: the **UEFI boot payload** (TFTP content) was incomplete/inconsistent.

* `wdsmgfw.efi` downloadable ‚úî
* `boot.sdi` / `boot.wim` either missing/misplaced/not readable at first

---

## Sanity Checks (proved the path)

Enabled the Windows TFTP client and pulled the exact files the firmware needs:

```cmd
tftp -i 10.0.0.10 GET "Boot\x64\wdsmgfw.efi"
tftp -i 10.0.0.10 GET "Boot\x64\Images\boot.sdi"
tftp -i 10.0.0.10 GET "Boot\x64\Images\boot.wim"
tftp -i 10.0.0.10 GET "Boot\x64\default.bcd"
```

* Early on, `boot.sdi`/`boot.wim` failed ‚Üí later fixed (see next section).
* Once all four downloaded successfully, the client proceeded.

---

## Fix: Stage the right UEFI boot files

Used the Windows ISO to source the files:

* Verified WIM contents:

  ```cmd
  dism /English /Get-WimInfo /WimFile:D:\sources\boot.wim
  ```

  Output shows:

  * Index 1: **Microsoft Windows PE (amd64)**
  * Index 2: **Microsoft Windows Setup (amd64)**

* Staged the payload where WDS serves UEFI boot:

  ```powershell
  $dst = 'C:\RemoteInstall\Boot\x64\Images'
  New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $dst | Out-Null
  Copy-Item 'C:\Windows\Boot\DVD\PCAT\boot.sdi' "$dst\boot.sdi" -Force
  Copy-Item 'D:\sources\boot.wim'              "$dst\boot.wim" -Force
  ```

> Note: Files **copied manually** into `RemoteInstall\Boot\x64\Images` are **not ‚Äúregistered‚Äù WDS images** (they have no WDS Image GUID). That‚Äôs fine for **default UEFI boot** (WDS just needs the files present), but you won‚Äôt see these in `Get-WdsBootImage`.

---

## WDS image store cleanup (optional)

MMC showed a default **‚ÄúMicrosoft Windows Setup (x64)‚Äù** boot image.
Deleting failed with **‚ÄúAccess is denied‚Äù** because it was the default/in use.

Two ways to handle it:

### PowerShell (when the image was *added* via WDS and has an ID)

```powershell
Import-Module WDS
Get-WdsBootImage | ft Name,Architecture,ImageGroup,ImageGuid

# If found, clear default then remove:
$img = Get-WdsBootImage | ? { $_.Name -eq 'Microsoft Windows Setup (amd64)' -and $_.Architecture -eq 'x64' }
try { Set-WdsBootImage -ImageGuid $img.ImageGuid -IsDefault:$false -ErrorAction Stop } catch {}
Remove-WdsBootImage -ImageGuid $img.ImageGuid -Force
```

### WDSUTIL equivalents

```cmd
wdsutil /Get-AllImages /ImageType:Boot
wdsutil /Get-Image /ImageType:Boot /Architecture:x64 /Image:"Microsoft Windows Setup (amd64)" /Show:All
wdsutil /Set-Image /ImageType:Boot /Architecture:x64 /Image:"Microsoft Windows Setup (amd64)" /IsDefault:No
wdsutil /Remove-Image /ImageType:Boot /Architecture:x64 /Image:"Microsoft Windows Setup (amd64)"
```

> If the image was never ‚Äúadded‚Äù (you only copied files), it won‚Äôt have a GUID and won‚Äôt appear in the PowerShell cmdlets. That‚Äôs expected.

If you get locked files/errors, bounce services:

```cmd
net stop wdsserver
net stop dhcpserver
net start dhcpserver
net start wdsserver
```

---

## Client Config (VirtualBox)

* **Firmware**: UEFI
* **NIC model**: Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop (82540EM) or 82543GC
* **Network**: Attached to the same **Internal Network** name as the server (e.g., `LabNet`)
* **Promiscuous**: Deny (default)
* **PXE path**: From UEFI boot menu choose **UEFI PXEv4** on that NIC

---

## Outcome

* After staging **`wdsmgfw.efi`**, **`boot.sdi`**, **`boot.wim`**, and verifying TFTP access, the UEFI client downloaded the boot payload and reached **Windows Setup** over PXE.
* The earlier **0xc0000001** was resolved by fixing **`boot.wim`** and **`boot.sdi`** placement/availability.

---

## Commands Reference (used in this lab)

```cmd
:: Verify TFTP/ProxyDHCP
netstat -an | findstr ":69"
netstat -an | findstr ":4011"

:: Set UEFI boot programs
wdsutil /set-server /bootprogram:boot\x64\wdsmgfw.efi /architecture:x64uefi
wdsutil /set-server /n12bootprogram:boot\x64\wdsmgfw.efi /architecture:x64uefi

:: DISM inspect WIM
dism /English /Get-WimInfo /WimFile:D:\sources\boot.wim

:: TFTP sanity pulls
tftp -i 10.0.0.10 GET "Boot\x64\wdsmgfw.efi"
tftp -i 10.0.0.10 GET "Boot\x64\Images\boot.sdi"
tftp -i 10.0.0.10 GET "Boot\x64\Images\boot.wim"
tftp -i 10.0.0.10 GET "Boot\x64\default.bcd"
```

---

## Lessons Learned

* **UEFI + WDS** does **not** need DHCP 66/67; setting 67 often breaks UEFI.
* If you see **‚ÄúContacting Server‚Ä¶‚Äù** forever or **0xc0000001**, verify the **TFTP path** with real downloads.
* **VirtualBox NIC** must be an **E1000** variant; paravirtualized/virtio has no PXE ROM.
* Files copied into `RemoteInstall\Boot\x64\Images` are used by UEFI **even if not registered** as WDS images (no GUID).
* If a WDS boot image won‚Äôt delete, **remove the default flag** or **restart WDS** and delete by GUID.

---

### Status

‚úÖ PXE (UEFI) boot to Windows Setup works on an isolated VirtualBox network using a single Server 2022 VM running AD DS/DNS/DHCP/WDS.
