My personal IT home lab projects: Active Directory, Group Policy, Intune, etc

# Brandon‚Äôs IT Home Lab

This repo documents my IT lab projects as I work toward becoming a System Administrator.

## Projects
- **Active Directory Domain Setup**  
  Built a Windows Server 2022 domain controller, added DNS & DHCP, and joined Windows 10 clients.
  ## üõ†Ô∏è Active Directory Domain Setup

  üîπ Lab Setup
- **Host Machine**: Windows 11 Pro, 16 GB RAM, Intel i7-12700H  
- **External Storage**: Crucial X10 1TB Portable SSD  
- **Virtualization**: VirtualBox 7.x  

 Virtual Machines
- **DC01** ‚Äì Windows Server 2022 (Domain Controller)  
- **Win10-Client01** ‚Äì Windows 10 Pro (domain-joined client)
- 
 üîπ What I‚Äôve Built So Far
- Installed **Windows Server 2022** on DC01  
- Promoted server to **Domain Controller** for domain `lab.local`  
- Configured **static IP addressing** (10.0.0.10 for DC, 10.0.0.101 for client)  
- Installed and configured **DNS** (forwarders + internal records)  
- Cleaned up DNS zone to fix resolution issues  
- Added **DeptDocs shared folder** with NTFS + Share permissions  
- Joined **Windows 10 client** to the domain  
- Confirmed **AD user logon** (`lab\TestUser`) from client  
- Enabled **Group Policy Management** for domain users  
- Fixed **networking** with dual NICs (Internal Network for lab + NAT for Interne
- Created a network share with ntfs permissions

## üîπ Troubleshooting Wins
- Solved DNS forwarder problems (Google 8.8.8.8, Cloudflare 1.1.1.1)  
- Cleaned up NAT adapter records polluting DNS zone  
- Fixed issue where `\\dc01\DeptDocs` didn‚Äôt work by aligning DNS records  
- Learned difference between A record vs CNAME for hostname resolution  

What I Learned
- How AD DS centralizes authentication and management
- How DNS integrates with Active Directory for name resolution
- How DHCP scopes automate client IP addressing
- Troubleshooting common issues (DNS misconfig, DHCP scope errors, client join failures)
- Hands-on use of Server Manager and Active Directory Users & Computers (ADUC)
- Group Policy (GPO)  
- File and Folder Permissions (NTFS + Share)  
- Windows networking (Internal vs NAT adapters in VirtualBox)  
- Troubleshooting DNS + SMB issues



- **Group Policy Testing**  
  Created GPOs to manage BitLocker, enforce password policies, and control user environments.  

- **Microsoft 365 + Entra ID (Azure AD)**  
  Experimented with hybrid join, Intune enrollment, and Microsoft 365 admin settings.
  Tenant & Intune

  Microsoft Intune & Entra ID Lab

This project demonstrates end-to-end modern endpoint management and security using Microsoft Intune and Entra ID in a Windows 11 virtual lab. The goal was to simulate real enterprise scenarios: packaging and deploying apps, enforcing compliance, managing updates, and securing access with Conditional Access.

üîπ Lab Highlights

App Deployment ‚Üí Packaged VLC Media Player with the Win32 Content Prep Tool, deployed via Intune, and validated with detection rules.

Configuration Policies ‚Üí Enforced Windows Hello PIN requirements (length, complexity, history).

Update Management ‚Üí Created a Pilot Update Ring deferring feature updates by 7 days, quality updates by 2 days.

Endpoint Security ‚Üí Configured Microsoft Defender Antivirus (real-time + cloud protection, scheduled scans) and Defender Firewall (enabled for all profiles).

Conditional Access ‚Üí Built a policy requiring devices to be marked compliant before accessing Microsoft 365 apps.

Reporting & Monitoring ‚Üí Tracked compliance, app deployment status, and update ring assignments in the Intune Admin Center.

üîπ Challenges & Learning Process

VirtualBox limitations ‚Üí BitLocker was skipped since encryption can cause boot issues in VMs. Learned when to adapt lab design to the environment.

Policy conflicts ‚Üí Encountered PIN length conflicts between Endpoint Security and Configuration Profiles. Learned to consolidate settings and avoid overlap.

App packaging issues ‚Üí Needed to use .\IntuneWinAppUtil.exe correctly in Command Prompt, and confirm silent install commands for detection.

Conditional Access setup ‚Üí Had to disable Security Defaults in Entra to enable custom CA policies ‚Äî discovered how defaults vs. CA policies differ.

Sync delays ‚Üí Learned Intune reporting isn‚Äôt instant; forced device syncs and waited for compliance/app install state updates.

Each issue deepened understanding of how Intune and Entra ID behave in real-world environments.

üîπ Next Steps

Add BitLocker encryption testing outside VM environment.

Package additional Win32/MSI apps (7-Zip, Notepad++).

Expand Conditional Access with MFA and location-based rules.

Explore automation with PowerShell + Graph API for bulk deployments.

Created a brand-new Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) tenant.

Activated a Microsoft Intune Plan 1 Trial subscription (25 seats).

Verified the subscription in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (Billing ‚Üí Your products).

User Setup

Created / used a test Azure AD user.

Assigned an Intune license to that user in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (Licenses & apps).

MDM / Enrollment Configuration

In Intune admin center ‚Üí Devices ‚Üí Enrollment ‚Üí Windows enrollment ‚Üí Automatic Enrollment:

Set MDM user scope = All (so any licensed user‚Äôs device auto-enrolls).

In Entra admin center ‚Üí Devices ‚Üí Device settings:

Confirmed that users are allowed to join devices to Azure AD.

Reset Secure Boot keys to allow Win11 to pass requirements.

Windows 11 Virtual Machine

Installed VirtualBox 7.x.

Created a dedicated VM storage folder: D:\IT-Lab\VMs.

Downloaded official Windows 11 ISO (5.15 GB) via Microsoft‚Äôs MCT/download page.

Created new VM in VirtualBox with:

Windows 11 Pro (64-bit)

8 GB RAM (6144 MB)

2 CPUs (you can safely bump to 4 since you have 20 logical cores)

Chipset = ICH9

EFI + Secure Boot enabled

TPM 2.0 added

Video Memory = 128 MB

Graphics Controller = VBoxSVGA

SATA Controller (AHCI): Port 0 = Win11-Intune.vdi (64 GB), Port 1 = Optical Drive ‚Üí Windows11.iso

Use Host I/O Cache = On

Boot order: Optical ‚Üí Hard Disk

Windows 11 OOBE

Completed installer and OOBE screens step by step:

Set region, keyboard, skip second keyboard.

Chose Set up for work or school.

Signed in with Azure AD user (licensed).

Approved Microsoft Authenticator MFA.

Created a PIN that meets complexity requirements.

VM successfully booted to desktop as an Entra ID joined device.
